## Changes

* __NEW__/__BREAKING__ action : `bitrise-machine setup` will skip the cleanup & SSH setup if it detects that the host is already prepared. You can force the full setup by adding the `--force` flag: `bitrise-machine setup --force`


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -L https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-machine/releases/download/0.9.1/bitrise-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-machine`!
