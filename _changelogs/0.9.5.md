## Changes

* Added support for `vagrant` v1.8.x 's new `vagrant ssh-config` output format,
  which now wraps the IdentityPath in quotation marks.
* Can now also work with Identity Paths which include space in the path.

__IMPORTANT__ : the CLI package changed how it handles if a command has arguments with flags and specifies `SkipFlagParsing: true` - so we'll switch back to `SkipFlagParsing: false` - the command to run on the remote should be prefixed with `--` in case of `run`.

This means that `bitrise-machine --workdir=... run -timeout=0 ls -alh` won't work anymore,
you have to add the `--` separator: `bitrise-machine --workdir=... run -timeout=0 -- ls -alh`.


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-tools/bitrise-machine/releases/download/0.9.5/bitrise-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-machine`!
