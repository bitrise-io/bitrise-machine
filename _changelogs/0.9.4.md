## Changes

* __NEW__ flag : if you define `--abort-check-url` for `bitrise-machine run` it'll periodically check the given URL, and will abort the `run` if it receives a JSON response with `"status": "ok"` and `"is_aborted": true`


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-tools/bitrise-machine/releases/download/0.9.4/bitrise-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-machine`!
