## Changes

* Go CPU Profiling can now be enabled by setting the `BITRISE_MACHINE_CPU_PROFILE_FILEPATH`
  Environment Variable to a file path, e.g. `export BITRISE_MACHINE_CPU_PROFILE_FILEPATH=./cpu.profile`.
  This profile can be used directly with Go's [`pprof` command line tool](http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs).
* **Optimized Log handling**: less frequent log chunk processing (instead of doing it every 100ms the tick is now 500ms),
  and optimized log chunk buffer handling. **These changes should significantly reduce the CPU usage**,
  in a typical, sustained use case the difference can be 5-10x less CPU usage (~3% CPU usage
  where the previous version was around 20-25% on the same machine).


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-tools/bitrise-machine/releases/download/0.9.7/bitrise-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-machine`!
