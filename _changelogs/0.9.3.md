## Changes

* First version with official __LINUX__ binary release!
* New cleanup modes: `recreate` implemented, `custom` also available (you can specify a custom `vagrant` action for cleanup. For example for the DigitalOcean provider a built-in `recreate` action is available, which is more efficient than a full recreate).
* Environment Variables can also be specified in the `bitrise.machine.config.json` file.
* __NEW COMMAND__ : `destroy` - to help with completely destroying the "machine".


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -fL https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-machine/releases/download/0.9.3/bitrise-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bitrise-machine
```

That's all, you're ready to call `bitrise-machine`!
